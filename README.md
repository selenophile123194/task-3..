Data Analysis
Summary:
Data Analysis Key Findings
The tabular housing data was successfully loaded from /content/sample_data/california_housing_train.csv.
The house_images dictionary mapping house IDs to image paths was confirmed to be available.
Image feature extraction using a pre-trained VGG16 model failed due to issues with opening and processing the image files, resulting in no image features being extracted.
Despite the failure in image feature extraction, the data preparation step successfully merged the tabular data with an empty (or all-zero) image feature DataFrame, handling missing values by filling them with 0.
A GradientBoostingRegressor model was successfully trained on the combined (effectively tabular-only due to the image feature extraction failure) data.
Model evaluation provided the following performance metrics on the test set:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): $37585.99
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): $54436.15
Insights or Next Steps
Investigate and fix the issue preventing the successful loading and processing of image files to enable true multimodal learning.
Once image features can be extracted, retrain the model with the actual image features and re-evaluate its performance to see if incorporating image data improves prediction accuracy (reduces MAE and RMSE).
Housing Price Prediction using Multimodal Data
This project aims to predict housing prices by combining tabular housing data with features extracted from house images using a multimodal machine learning approach.

Task
Analyze a provided housing sales dataset and a custom image dataset to predict housing prices using a multimodal machine learning approach. This involves using CNNs to extract features from images, combining these features with the tabular data, training a regression model on the combined data, and evaluating its performance using MAE and RMSE.

Data Loading
The tabular housing data was loaded from /content/sample_data/california_housing_train.csv using pandas. A dictionary house_images containing house IDs and corresponding image paths was also used.

Image Feature Extraction
A pre-trained VGG16 model was intended to be used to extract features from each house image. However, there were errors in processing the image files, resulting in no image features being extracted.

Data Preparation
The tabular data was merged with a DataFrame intended for image features. Due to the image processing errors, this resulted in a merged DataFrame containing the tabular data and all-zero columns for the image features. Missing values were handled by filling with 0.

Model Training
A GradientBoostingRegressor model from scikit-learn was trained on the combined data. Since the image feature extraction failed, the model was effectively trained only on the tabular data.

Model Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated on a test set using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 37585.99∗∗∗RootMeanSquaredError(RMSE):∗∗54436.15
Summary and Next Steps
Data Analysis Key Findings:

The tabular housing data was successfully loaded.
The house_images dictionary was available.
Image feature extraction using VGG16 failed due to issues with opening and processing image files.
Data preparation merged the tabular data with empty image features, resulting in a dataset effectively containing only tabular data for training.
A GradientBoostingRegressor was trained successfully on the tabular data.
The model's performance was evaluated, yielding an MAE of 37585.99andRMSEof54436.15.
Insights or Next Steps:

Investigate and fix the image processing issue: The primary next step is to resolve the errors encountered during image loading and processing to enable the extraction of actual image features. This is crucial for implementing the intended multimodal approach.
Retrain and re-evaluate: Once image features can be successfully extracted, the model should be retrained using the combined tabular and image data. The model's performance should then be re-evaluated to determine if incorporating image data improves the accuracy of housing price predictions (i.e., reduces MAE and RMSE).
